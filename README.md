# Background

I've done **very** preliminary data analysis on Asian representation in the core federal public service using the [publicly available TBS data](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/human-resources-statistics/diversity-inclusion-statistics/distribution-public-service-canada-employees-designated-sub-group-department-members-visible-minorities.html). The purpose of this investigation is to provide justification for creating an interdepartmental inventory of bridgeable students who identify as Asian. A webpage with outputs and findings can be found [here](https://klaxonklaxoff.github.io/nafe_stats/).

It should be noted that students are not included in these count as they belong to the GA classification and are not accounted for in the TBS data. However, we can still take information gained from this analysis to demonstrate the low representation of Asian in the core federal public service. In the 2016 Census 6,095,235 people in Canada reported having Asian origins, representing 17.7% of Canada's population.[^1]
